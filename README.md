# üëã **Hi there, I'm Eduardo**

I've been dedicating myself to **computer science** for the last six years, with a particular interest in the artificial intelligence field. My journey began with a **bachelor's degree** at **Universidade Federal de Uberl√¢ndia (UFU)**, where I developed a passion for research and computer vision, which led me to pursue a **master's degree**. I was able to attain a scholarship at **Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG)**, and during this time, I was a member of the [**Laborat√≥rio de Vis√£o Computacional e Rob√≥tica (VeRLab)**](https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/) team, where I was exposed to a variety of new technologies, improving my skills with handcrafted and deep-learning techniques applied to computer vision and other pattern recognition tasks.

## **Let me show you my main projects:**

- [**Structural Reasoning for Image-based Social Relation Recognition:**](https://github.com/eduardoatr/Structural_Reasoning_SRR) This repository contains the **Python** code used to generate all the models presented in my last paper and dissertation, which introduces novel graph representations and graph convolution methods applied to the social relation recognition problem. Some of the tools used in this project: **PyTorch**, **Caffe**, **Deep Graph Library**, **TensorBoard**, **Numpy**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Pillow**, and **h5py**.
- [**MaGI: Multi-attribute Graph Inference for Social Relationship Recognition:**](https://github.com/eduardoatr/Multi_attribute_Graph_Inference_SRR) This repository contains the **Python** code of a previous iteration of my paper, where I measured the contribution of multiple features combined with a graph propagation model to the social relation recognition problem. Some of the tools used in this project: **Tensorflow**, **Caffe**, **TensorBoard**, **Numpy**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **Pillow**.
- [**Reconhecimento Facial Infravermelho:**](https://github.com/eduardoatr/Reconhecimento_Facial_Infravermelho) This repository contains **MATLAB** code for a study where I compared the effects of employing infrared images against visible spectrum images to the facial recognition task. Here, I implemented the **Eigenfaces** and **Fisherfaces** algorithms, which are based on the **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**, and also I used the **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** method combined with various metrics for classification.

## **And here are some smaller projects:**

- [**Framework Professor-Aluno:**](https://github.com/eduardoatr/Professor_Aluno) In this project, I tested the **Teacher-Student Framework** for reinforcement learning applied to **DQN agents** in the CartPole game using **Python**. Some of the tools used in this project: **Tensorflow**, **Gym**, and **Numpy**.
- [**Anomaly Detector:**](https://github.com/eduardoatr/Anomaly_Detection) Here, I tried to implement an image-based anomaly detector using **Python** and **handcrafted methods**, including keypoints **detectors**, **descriptors**, **templated matching** and others. Some of the tools used in this project: **OpenCV**, **Scikit-Image**, and **Numpy**.
- [**Computer Vision Notebooks:**](https://github.com/eduardoatr/Computer_Vision_Notebooks) This repository contains four **Jupyter notebooks** for multiple computer vision tasks, including: a **camera calibration** implementation, a comparison between **CNNs** and **BOF**, a **Harris corner detector** implementation, a **picture mosaic** implementation. Some of the tools used in these projects: **PyTorch**, **OpenCV**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Matplotlib**, **Numpy**, and **Scipy**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è I also have some other projects where I implemented from scratch a **reinforcement learning agent**, multiple **search algorithms** and **heuristics**, various **graph algorithms**, and **machine learning classifiers**. Take a look at my [**repositories**](https://github.com/eduardoatr?tab=repositories)!
